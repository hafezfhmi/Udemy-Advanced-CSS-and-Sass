1. We want the font size to be 10px. So by default, user will have 16px and if we do the math, 16 * 62.5% = 10px.
The reason we set the root font size with percentage is because, if the user modified their font size, let's say 20px, 
the root font size won't deviate much from 10px (20 * 62.5 = 12.5px). 
We don't want to overwrite the user's font size for their accessibility.
